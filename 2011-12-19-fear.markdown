##Fear

I'm sitting in an airport right now, about to embark on a living embodiment of
fear. 

I hate flying. Perhaps it's just irrationality, or perhaps it's that burden of
knowledge that there is a thousand-ton vehicle about to go careening down a
finite runway towards a seemingly-infinite ocean, only to, a few hours later,
come careening down towards another finite strip of asphalt at exceptional
speed. It's just the physics that gets me. None of it seems at all safe -- and
while I know that there are far fewer plane accidents than train or car
accidents each year, it doesn't alleviate my terror at the prospect of breaking
up at thirty-two thousand feet above our little marble.

I also hate spiders, and needles, and probably more things than I have a right
to hate.

Suffice it that I am often afraid, almost always without cause. So why do I get
on the plane? Why do I keep going? If I am terrified, why don't I just not do
any of it?

##Family

So, I'm sitting here at Gate A-two-one -- that's what they keep saying, as if we
wouldn't figure it out if they just said "A twenty-one" -- awaiting this coach
of (what I imagine to be) death. I'm going to Sunny California, going to see my
inlaws. As I await my inevitable demise, I quietly think to myself, "Fucking
inlaws, if it weren't for them, I could be home. Enjoying the cold and playing
video games." I'm burning off the rest of my vacation time for the year, so I'd
be taking vacation in any case, but so motivated was I by that
pretty-lady-who-feeds-me, that here I await the reaper.

So I'm motivated to fly, against (perhaps) my better judgement (and
certainly against my will), but I will perservere to make that scary-wife-lady
happy, because it's Christmas, and while Santa Clause and Jesus Christ may be
bullshit, my wife's happiness isn't. So how can I get through my fear? How can I
deal with the fact that in less than three hours, I'll be hurtling through the
upper atmosphere?

##Finding Confidence

When I'm coding, there are -- many times -- changes which need to be made, but
appear to be hard. Changes that are sweeping, changes that involve large
deletions, or philosophical changes to how the project is approached. Sometimes
it's about using a new tool to solve an old problem. Sometimes it's about
realizing a certain cross-cutting concern has been slicing into the codebase in
a nonoptimal way. It's a hard change because the team might be against it, or
maybe the team is for it, but they don't understand how the tool is "really"
supposed to be used.

Similar to flying, we are often motivated by necessity to make these changes,
but are hesitant due to fear. We're afraid that the thing won't work, that our
whole infrastructure will come tumbling down, that everything will generally go
to shit and we'll get fired. Or worse, we _won't_ get fired, and will have to
live with the shame as we pick up the tattered peices of a product. 

The risk may be great, and that risk is directly proportional to the fear it
induces, but I'm reminded of a quote from one of my favorite books:

> I must not fear.
>
> Fear is the _mind-killer_.
>
> Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
>
> I will face my fear.
>
> I will _permit_ it to pass over me and through me.
>
> When it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
>
> Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.
>
> Only I will remain. 
>
>
> -- Bene Gesserit Litany against Fear, Dune, Frank Hebert

The problem of rejecting risk due to induced fear is that -- oftentimes -- that
induced fear is phantasmal. It's _not_ going to crash and burn, it's _not_ going
to drive the company into the ground. In fact, the opposite -- it will build the
company up.

##Make Fear Fuel

I peruse, often, [Ward's Wiki](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki). Amongst the thousands of
amazing articles, there is one which I dearly love --
[MakeFearFuel](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MakeFearFuel). In it, the argument is made
to -- rather than shirk from risk due to fear -- to embrace it for the same
reason. If you're afraid of something, it's natural, it's okay. Fear is designed to
protect you. However, Fear is _not_ designed to _paralyze you_. Fear is a tool
to enable you to run faster and further, to be more aware of your actions and
surroundings -- these latter two especially are of great use to a programmer.
The fear from risk comes from the unknown -- the inability to see all paths.
However, that self-same fear can be _harnessed_, and made to work _for_ you, to
make your product better, to see further, to build something better.

As the article suggests, Don't think of it as fear -- but rather -- excitement!
You must _permit_ fear -- not 'allow' or 'be okay with', you are in control of
fear -- to pass through you. Fear is subservient, not superior, and when you
understand the use of fear as fuel, and moreover, when you begin to apply it to
your life (and not just programming, but everywhere), I think you will find
yourself more amenable to making good changes, better at mitigating undue risk,
and better at recovering from problems when shit really does hit the fan. 

For my part, I'm being called to board this black coach, to sit amongst my
brothers and sisters before death. I will not fear, fear is the mind-killer, I
will face my fear, and give fear the finger.
