For now, this is a bit of a placeholder site to alleviate my blogging addiction.
I have bigger plans in the works for my own site, but I wanted somewhere to
hang out in the meantime. 

Occurs to me, didn't tell you who I am. I'm Joe Fredette, Mathematician, Haskell Hacker,
Rubyist, Web Developer, and generally amazing person. I like to do math, write
software, play video games, and talk to much. This is my blog, it will house
many things, including words from my brain. You have been warned.

Hope you like it around here!
